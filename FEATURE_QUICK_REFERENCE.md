# Quick Reference: American Accent Features

## How Each Feature Works

### 🎯 1. STRESS
**What it is**: Some syllables LOUD, others quiet  
**How to spot**: Numbers in ARPAbet (0, 1, 2)  
**Example**: PHOtograph (F OW**1** T AH**0** G R AE**2** F)  
**Practice**: Say "BA-na-na" with stress on middle "na"

---

### 🎵 2. RHYTHM  
**What it is**: Stressed syllables like a drum beat  
**How to spot**: 3+ syllables with mix of stressed/unstressed  
**Example**: CHOCOlate → sounds like "CHOC-late" (2 beats, not 3)  
**Practice**: Tap table on stressed syllables only

---

### 🔽 3. REDUCTION
**What it is**: Unstressed vowels → "uh" sound (schwa)  
**How to spot**: AH0 in ARPAbet  
**Example**: a**BOUT** → "uh-BOUT" (not "ay-bout")  
**Practice**: Say "uh-uh-uh" quickly - that's schwa!

---

### 🔗 4. LINKING
**What it is**: Connect words without pauses  
**How to spot**: Underscore in word (turn_it_off)  
**Example**: "check it out" → "che-ki-tout"  
**Practice**: Say "an apple" as "a-napple" (one word)

---

### 🔄 5. ASSIMILATION  
**What it is**: T+Y → "CH", D+Y → "J"  
**How to spot**: T or D followed by Y sound  
**Example**: "did you" → "di-JOO" (sounds like "j")  
**Practice**: Say "gotcha" - that's "got you" with assimilation

---

### ⚡ 6. T-FLAPPING
**What it is**: T between vowels → quick tap (like Spanish R)  
**How to spot**: DX in ARPAbet, or T between vowels  
**Example**: WA**T**ER → "WAH-der" (sounds like D)  
**Practice**: "writer" = "rider" in American accent

---

### 🌑 7. DARK L
**What it is**: L at end = deep "ull" sound  
**How to spot**: L at end of syllable  
**Example**: "feel" → "fee-ull" (NOT "fee-l")  
**Practice**: Say "milk" - tongue back is raised, sounds dark

---

### ⭕ 8. GLOTTALIZATION  
**What it is**: T before N → throat closure (no T sound)  
**How to spot**: T N in ARPAbet  
**Example**: bu**tt**on → "bu-'n" (T replaced by glottal stop)  
**Practice**: Say "mountain" as "moun-'n" - T disappears

---

### 🅱️ 9. R-COLORING
**What it is**: R always pronounced, curled tongue  
**How to spot**: ER or R in ARPAbet  
**Example**: ca**R** → "carr" (NOT British "cah")  
**Practice**: Curl tongue back for every R

---

### 💨 10. ASPIRATION
**What it is**: P/T/K at start = puff of air  
**How to spot**: P, T, or K at beginning of stressed syllable  
**Example**: **P**in → "pʰin" (strong air burst)  
**Practice**: Hold hand before mouth - should feel air

---

### 👃 11. NASAL FLAP
**What it is**: NT → flap + nasal (sounds like "nner")  
**How to spot**: N T or N DX in ARPAbet  
**Example**: wi**nt**er → "WIN-ner" (T becomes flap)  
**Practice**: "twenty" → "twenny" in casual speech

---

### 📈 12. INTONATION
**What it is**: Voice pitch goes up ↗ or down ↘  
**How to spot**: Questions rise, statements fall  
**Example**: "Really?" ↗ (question) vs "Really." ↘ (statement)  
**Practice**: Hum the melody of a sentence

## Quick Detection Cheat Sheet

| Feature | Look For | ARPAbet Clue |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Stress** | Multiple syllables | Has 1 or 2 markers |
| **Rhythm** | 3+ syllables | Mix of 0, 1, 2 |
| **Reduction** | Weak vowels | AH0 |
| **Linking** | Word combos | underscore _ |
| **Assimilation** | t+you, d+you | T Y or D Y |
| **T-Flap** | T between vowels | DX or V-T-V pattern |
| **Dark L** | L at end | L at end or before consonant |
| **Glottal** | T before N | T N |
| **R-Color** | Any R | ER or R |
| **Aspiration** | Start P/T/K | P/T/K at beginning |
| **Nasal Flap** | NT combo | N T or N DX |
| **Intonation** | Question/emphasis | (pitch pattern) |

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Spot the Feature
Look at these words and identify features:

1. **water** (W AA1 DX ER0) → T-flap, R-coloring, Stress
2. **button** (B AH1 T N) → Glottalization, Stress  
3. **banana** (B AH0 N AE1 N AH0) → Reduction, Stress, Rhythm

### Exercise 2: Minimal Pairs
- writer ≈ rider (T-flapping makes them identical!)
- pin ≠ bin (aspiration on P vs no aspiration on B)
- record (noun) ≠ record (verb) (stress changes meaning)

### Exercise 3: Feature Hunting
For each word you practice:
1. Look at ARPAbet pronunciation
2. Find numbers (0,1,2) → **stress**
3. Find AH0 → **reduction**
4. Find DX → **t-flap**
5. Find R/ER → **r-coloring**
6. Find T N → **glottalization**

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Three-syllable words often show
- Stress (on one syllable)
- Reduction (schwa on others)
- Rhythm (compressed syllables)

**Example**: photograph (F OW**1** T AH**0** G R AE**2** F)

### Pattern 2: -ER endings often show
- R-coloring (ER sound)
- T-flapping (if after vowel+T)
- Reduction (unstressed)

**Example**: water (W AA1 DX ER0), butter (B AH1 DX ER0)

### Pattern 3: -TEN/-TON words often show
- Glottalization (T → glottal stop)
- Nasal sound dominates

**Example**: button, kitten, cotton, mountain

## Tips for Learning

1. **Start with one feature**: Master stress before moving to t-flapping
2. **Use your ears**: Listen to native speakers on YouGlish
3. **Record yourself**: Compare to native pronunciation
4. **Practice daily**: 5-10 minutes consistently beats 1-hour cramming
5. **Focus on common words**: Master "water" before "photographic"
6. **Shadow native speakers**: Repeat immediately after hearing
7. **Exaggerate at first**: Overdo the feature, then tone it down

## Most Important Features (Priority Order)

1. **Stress** - Changes meaning, always critical
2. **Reduction** - Makes you sound natural vs robotic
3. **T-Flapping** - Very common, sounds "American"
4. **R-Coloring** - Key American accent marker
5. **Linking** - For fluent, connected speech
6. **Rhythm** - Overall flow and pacing
7. **Dark L** - Common ending sound
8. **Aspiration** - Distinguishes words (pin/bin)
9. **Glottalization** - Casual speech patterns
10. **Intonation** - Emotion and question types
11. **Assimilation** - Fast/casual speech
12. **Nasal Flap** - Style variation
